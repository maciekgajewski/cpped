# Project manifest
## Desing goals
* Simple C++ IDE
* Based on my (and my friends'?) use patterns
* Terminal (ncurses?) frontend, so that it can be used over SSH session with Putty, for instance
* Nothing fancy. Fast and simple
* C++ only
* Clang-generated code model, highlighting and other tools
* Convenient, Windows-style editing with mouse support
* Possibility to add Vim mode (if someone is willing to implement it)
* Cmake project support.
* GDB integration
* Keybord-centered UI, with the ability to use mouse (Like QtCreator)
* Spellchecking for comments and strings

## UI features
* Line numbers
* Syntax highlighting
* QtCreator-like ctrl-k menu (I love it!)
* Code navigation history (alt + <-, alt + ->)
* Code completion
* Quick header/cpp switch
